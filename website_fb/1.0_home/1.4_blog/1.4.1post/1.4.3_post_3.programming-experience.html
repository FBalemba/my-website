          <p>3. Programming experience - taken from the SKC questionnaire</p>
          <p>Sorry i didn't get proper feedback from the SKC assignment </p>
          <p>Most of my programming experience is with python when i was working with local large langue models and stable diffusion, flux, and other projects.</p>
          <p>My first impression is that html and css seems fun and nice to work with and i am keeping a personal command list for both frameworks for ease of use.</p>
          <p>I do have a long history of making tutorials, if I can be so generous as to classify that as programming the human body and mind to complete tasks.
