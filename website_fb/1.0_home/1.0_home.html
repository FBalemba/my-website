        <h3>Who am i:👨🏾‍💻</h3>
          <p>My name is Freud Balemba I'm currently a student at HZ University of Applied Sciences.</p>
          <p>I'm excited to learn how to program because i got multiple projects that i like to make. im exited to get the opportunity to learn how to make programs.</p>
          <p>I have a deep passion for ICT, and I love exploring all the different ways technology can shape our future.</p> 
          <p>I’m eager to take on new challenges, dive into projects, and expand my knowledge in the field of tech.</p>
          <p>From coding to networking to AI development i like to study and create, thats why i like to learn more about software development and more.</p>
          <p>I’m fascinated by how different aspects of ICT comes together to reshape the world.</p>
        <h4>List of projects done:💾 </h4>
          <ol>
            <li>AI voice training.</li>
            <li>AI chat bot and text to speech.</li>
            <li>AI image transformation.</li>
            <li>AI pc automation.</li>
            <li>Turing Test AI vs Human Quiz.</li>
            <li>Neural Radiance Fields using Instant-NGP.</li>
            <li>Product testing and Bug reporting for sillytavern AI.</li>
            <li>And much more.</li>

            This is a example of a project i worked on NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZTHlxMKta7c4r1rOZVuL7nRE375sDCRpoN2dphXMuq4/edit"> NeRF to Digital Twin Workflow.

          <p>This is a image of a NeRF Fox that i turned into a 3D Blender model made by me during my internship at the HZ.</p>
          <p>A NeRF is a Neural Radiance Field its a type of neural network used in computer vision and graphics to generate highly realistic 3D scenes from 2D images.</p>
          <p>It works by learning how light (or "radiance") behaves in a 3D space based on a collection of 2D images taken from different viewpoints.</p>
